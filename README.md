Refactoring made in order to:

    improve accessibility of the website to meet standards

    Improve semantic use of html in website code




    Changes:
    Colors checked and/or changed to meet WCAG 2 AAA Compliant (18pt+) standard

    Checked fonts for accessibility: deemed them acceptable

    Simplified code and switched <div> to semantic tags

    Attempted to rationalize the website's scalability 


    NOTE: I did not manage to successfully make the text able to scale to 200% without causing visual problems within the allotted time
